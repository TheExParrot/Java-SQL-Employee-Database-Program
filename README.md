# Java-SQL-Employee-Database-Program
A Java program that aims to interact with an SQL relational database and extract and save data to CSVs.

Before running the program a user would have to host an SQL database. The schema in the repository provides an example of a schema that works.
The user will also need to create a JSON that has each table name as an element with a list of each attribute under.
The GUI works mainly with natural joins so the database schema should be created accordingly.

Running the main in the program file will create a GUI that the user can interact with.
This allows the user to create an SQL statement without actually understanding SQL syntax that well.
